					Dear Parent/Guardian,<br><br>					 

					Following the tragic fire at Grenfell Tower in London, fire safety is at the forefront of everyone’s mind, and understandably so. As a school, we take health and safety matters very seriously.<br><br>					 

					We would like to make parents/guardians aware that the school building is only two stories high (8 meters) and does not have any Aluminium Composite Material (ACM) cladding.	<br><br>				​

					Notwithstanding the above, the school commissioned a new independent fire risk assessment in July 2017. The fire risk assessor found that the school is well managed and has all necessary fire safety provisions in place and is adequately maintained. No additional recommendations were made.	<br><br>				 

					We hope that the above reassures parents in regards to any fire safety concerns they may have.	<br><br>				 

					
					Head Teacher	<br>		 

					On behalf of the Governors
