					Madrasatul Mislima Academy offers a range of information, advice and guidance to assist pupils in making well informed and realistic decisions about their future options and careers.  The Academy will take a holistic approach and strive to expose the pupils to a range of information via different media to achieve the following outcomes: <br><br>
					Developing themselves through career and work-related education<br><br>

					Learning about careers and the world of work<br><br>

					Developing career management and employability skills<br><br>

					 

					Our commitment at the Academy is delivered through PSHE and Citizenship lessons as well as cross curricular links made between different subjects, and careers education and support from external professionals.  Some of the specific areas are as follows:<br><br>

					The programme is started in key stage 2 to enable pupils to engage at an early stage and to prepare them to investigate and explore the vast array of opportunities open to them.<br><br>					 

					Parents/carers will also be involved in the process so that they can assist, support and motivate their daughter to make well informed and realistic decisions.<br><br>				 

					As the law states, everyone must stay in learning until at least their eighteenth birthday, hence pupils have the following options:<br><br>					 

					A full time course, (a study programme) at a college or sixth form<br><br>	

					Learning while they work (work based learning) which includes apprenticeships, traineeships and study programmes that are based with training providers rather than with a college or sixth form<br><br>	

					Employment, voluntary work or entrepreneurship starting up their own business, concurrent with continued studies for a recognised qualification.<br><br>
