						<h4>Assalamu ‘alaykum and a very warm welcome to you!  </h4> 
					
						<p>				
						

						It is a pleasure and an honour for me to introduce myself as the Head Teacher at Jameah Girls Academy. I have been fortunate to have been a member of Jameah’s dedicated team almost since its inception in 2001. <br><br>

						 

						We have come such a long way since we started with a handful of pupils who followed the hifz programme, all being nurtured and cared for by a team of committed and caring teachers, leaders and governors. <br><br>
						Our ethos then, and now, is that each pupil in our care is an amaanah (trust), and deserves the best opportunities for realising her potential as a well-rounded British Muslim who is able to go on to achieve great things both within and beyond the classroom. <br><br>

						 

						We offer a rich, creative and stimulating curriculum to our pupils, and our excellent GCSE results, year after year are a testament to this.
						 By the end of their time with us, all our pupils have been given the opportunity to achieve their English Baccalaureate, and a great many complete either the Aalimiyyah Foundation programme or our renowned Tahfizul Quran programme in addition to this. Jameah Girls is so much more than a place where girls can achieve well academically; we embed comprehensive Islamic studies and tarbiyah programmes into our school day, helping our girls develop excellence in character and hold sound Islamic and British Values. <br><br>

						 

						We are a small school with a single-form entry, providing each class with a family atmosphere. Pupils are able to form strong bonds of friendship with their peers and we have an emphasis on pupil welfare and wellbeing. Pupils are encouraged to contribute to the life of the school through the Student Council, by taking part in assemblies and have opportunities for volunteering and leadership within school. Our pupils are from a diverse range of backgrounds and we strongly promote compassion towards others, tolerance and mutual respect among all our pupils and the wider world that we live in. <br><br> 

						 

						Our pupils are consistently encouraged to contribute significantly to the wider community. We are proud of the work our pupils do to support community and charity projects, at local, national and international levels. We also instil in our pupils a sense of pride in their lslamic and British values, as it is through these values that they can truly know who they are and be confident of their place in society. We strongly encourage our pupils to take part in activities which widen their horizons, and frequently ask guest speakers from diverse backgrounds and skills to work with them. This, coupled with an annual complement of trips outside of school, helps our pupils to know they can achieve anything once they leave us. Please refer to our careers section to learn more about how our girls are supported towards making informed choices about what path to take once they leave us. <br><br>

						 

						Our mainstay of support as a school comes from our fantastic parents. We welcome parents in during end of year assemblies and sports days, for workshops and as volunteers. We also welcome suggestions and feedback from parents. If you are considering sending your daughter to our school, please do pay us a visit, as meeting our pupils and staff is the best way of understanding what makes JGA the exceptional place it is. We also have an annual Open Day, and it would be great to see you there. <br><br> 

						 

						Should you have any queries, please do contact our school office, and we will be happy to help you.<br><br>

						 

						Wassalam,<br>
